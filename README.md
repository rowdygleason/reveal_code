# reveal_code

Kinetic "reveal code" functionality for Hotwire sent 20170503.
Developed by Rowdy Gleason using the techniques pioneered by the EMEA Responsys email development team.

Core functionality built into discrete kinetic style tag. Media query within can be adjusted to allow rendering on webkit browsers, currently disabled for most because of AOL bug that renders media query CSS but cannot render animations. Simple checkbox method with style input tags to give clickable space, adding height to div that is otherwise hidden when unchecked.
